This example iterates over a directory and all the sub-directories and
calculates the desity of all the text files in those directories. It then
averages the densities and displays the average. The density is defined as the
percentage of non-white space compared to the total number of characters in
the file.

The flow or connectivity of the Actors in the system are described by the
diagram that follows. The notation of a (n) indicates multiple instance of
that Actor.


dir_wq and calc_wq are WorkQueue Objects

    <top dir path> -> dir_wq -> Reader(n) -<file>-> calc_wq -> Calculator(n) -> Summary
                   ^                      -<dir>->
                   |                              |
                   |------------------------------|

Run the program as follows

    density.rb ../.. -v
